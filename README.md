# cs372-client-server-chat-portfolio

### About
This is a simple client-server chat program. It allows the client and server to send messages to each other using the terminal. My project was created as the final portfolio project for my course CS 372 Introduction to Computer Networks.

### Getting Started
To get started, download and unzip the files to get Server.py and
Client.py. Be sure to use Visual Studio Code that runs Python 3. My particular version is
Python 3.10.0.

1. Download and unzip both files, Server.py and Client.py
2. Using the terminal, run Server.py (and leave running)
    1. There should be a statement that the program is now listening...
3. Using a different terminal, run Client.py (and leave running)
    1. This should indicate a connection established in both terminals
4. Send messages back and forth
5. If either Client or Server wants to quit, type ‘/q’
a. Sockets close when either quits the chatting program.

### Built With
This project was built using Python 3.
